# US-International like Niu Mini layout for PCs with German set as input language

This layout aims to provide a US-International like layout for PCs that have German set as Input Language. This is useful for users living in germany, because it enables the use of the Niu Mini on any pc without having to switch the input language. It's mostly based on the Planck default layout, but adds essential features for german input, like a dead key layer to access ä, ö, ü.
