# gherkin super micro edition

With this configuration the "28" layout first experimented on the plank-like jj40 is being ported to a more proper board, leaving just two keys not used.

For more information please have a look at https://github.com/stevexyz/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/jj40/keymaps/stevexyz/readme.md 

The image below explain the main layers. In addition to them with q, w and e there are three specific dedicated layers for cursors/mouse, numpad and media.
